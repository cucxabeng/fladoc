## Fladoc

This is a **modern** markdown versionable documentation skeleton based on Flask framework.

The site has two main sections. The welcome page which is located at `templates/welcome.html` and the documentation pages.

### Documentation

The website's documentation is loaded from the `resources/docs` directory. You will need to clone each version of the documentation into this directory. For example, `resources/docs/0.12`, etc. The default index file is `documentation.md`. All of the example documentation is stored on GitHub at [cuonggt/flask-docs](https://github.com/cuonggt/flask-docs).
